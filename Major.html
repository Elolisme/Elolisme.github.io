        <h1>How the website was made</h1>
        <p>As websites are, This website was coded through A mix of HTML(hypertext markup language), css and a bit of javascript.
            A lot of the fancier elements to the website have been appropriated from a youtuber and frontend designer known as hyperplexed, the allow use of their code in public websites and have inspired me to have another attempt at making websites (hence this website).
        <br> Throughout coding this, I have learnt more skills such as how grids work with css, positioning elements and how to make colour palettes that don't burn peoples eyes while they view it.

        <h1>How the website was hosted</h1>
        <p>While creating the website I had to learn a few things, of which this is one. Apache2 is a port hosting thingy that allows files to be sent over the internet, allowing this website to exist. On my laptop I connect to my home internet, have apache running and have a website called <a href="https://www.noip.com/" class="link" style="text-decoration: underline;">no-ip<i class="fa-solid fa-note-sticky"></i></a><br>
        A basic summary of how this works would be, Apache2 allows the website to be accessed once the ip address is pointed to, and No-ip allows the address to be pointed to from a text url (in this case Imbadathosting.ddns.net)
